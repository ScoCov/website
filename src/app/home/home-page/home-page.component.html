      My name is Scott Covell, I was born in 1988 and have had an interesting path in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my working life aimless and working in services/labor positions. Being aimless I wasn't happy anywhere I worked. At the start of my 30's I finally went to college for Computer Science.
      I went to ECPI University in West Virginia. I was an online student and so was an accellerated program; which was perfect for my needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up I had dreams of being a Criminal Profiler but as time passed I learned that this path was not one I wanted to take. This is why I was aimless. It wasn't until I played a mod for the video game, Minecraft.
      The mod was called called 'ComputerCraft.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://computercraft.cc/" target="_blank">Computer Craft</a> was a mod for Minecraft with the goal to help educate people on scripting. The idea was  that you would get a robot, called a turtle, that you could program
      with the scripting language, Lua. This was my first experience with programming and it turned out I absolutely loved the process. I always remember struggling to create a very simplistic for-loop that caused
      the turtle to chop down a tree and 'clean it up.' That task took me nearly 3 days of trying and research to get done. Now, that would be a 5-10 minute coding session that would be far-far more robust due
      to being able to detect the object and have it accept data from the world - instead of hard coding as was my original design.
    </p>

      After I discovered computer craft I realised I wanted to do programming for a living. Not having a good financial situation, I tried teaching myself. I bought texts books on BASIC and Python and tried to
      teach myself programming. But I eventually got to a point where I wasn't sure what I was missing. I looked into going to college and discovered I would be able to do it. And, I think that going to college was
      the best thing for myself to do: I discovered I love and adore problem solving, especially in the form of programming problems.
